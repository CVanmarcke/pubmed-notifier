Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled kappa coefficients for Lung-RADS categorization and pooled intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for nodule size measurements. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using metaregression analyses. <b>Evidence Synthesis:</b> The analysis included 11 studies (1470 patients) for Lung-RADS categorization and five studies (617 patients) for nodule size measurement. Interreader agreement for Lung-RADS categorization was substantial (Îº=0.72 [95% CI, 0.57-0.82]), and for nodule size measurement was almost perfect (ICC=0.97 [95% CI, 0.90-0.99]). Interreader agreement for Lung-RADS categorization was significantly associated with the method of nodule measurement (p=.005), with pooled kappa coefficients for studies using computer-aided detection (CAD)-based semiautomated volume measurements, using CAD-based semiautomated diameter measurements, and using manual diameter measurements of 0.95, 0.91, and 0.66, respectively. Interreader agreement for Lung-RADS categorization was also significantly associated with studies' nodule type distribution (p&lt;.001), with pooled kappa coefficients for studies evaluating 100% solid nodules, 30-99% solid nodules, and &lt;30% solid nodules of 0.85, 0.76, and 0.55, respectively. Interreader agreement for nodule size measurement was significantly associated with radiation dose (p&lt;.001), with pooled ICCs for studies that used standard-dose CT, used low-dose CT, and used ultralow-dose CT of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.59, respectively. Interreader agreement for nodule size measurement was also significantly associated with the Lung-RADS version used (p=.02), with pooled ICCs for studies using Lung-RADS 1.1 and using Lung-RADS 1.0 of 0.99 and 0.93, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> While supporting the overall reliability of Lung-RADS, the findings indicate roles for CAD assistance as well as training and standardized approaches for nodule type characterization to further promote reproducible application. <b>Clinical Impact:</b> Consistent nodule assessments will be critical for Lung-RADS to optimally impact patient management and outcomes.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40202356/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=7708173&ff=20250416021922&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40202356</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.25.32681>10.2214/AJR.25.32681</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Jisun Hwang","Pyeong Hwa Kim","Seulgi You","You Na Kim","Joo Sung Sun"],"dates":["2025-04-09"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40202356","doi:10.2214/AJR.25.32681"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["AJR.

The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40202355/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=7708173&ff=20250416021922&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40202355</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.23.30768>10.2214/AJR.23.30768</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Joshua Cornman-Homonoff","Brett E Fortune","Kanti Pallav Kolli","Nishita Kothary","Gregory Nadolski","Bartley G Thornburg","Sumita Verma","David C Madoff"],"dates":["2025-04-09"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40202355","doi:10.2214/AJR.23.30768"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["AJR.

However, differentiating benign and malignant lesions remains challenging, particularly for foci. Studies evaluating other lesion types have identified ultrafast MRI (UFMRI) parameters associated with malignancy. <b>OBJECTIVE</b> - The purpose of this study was to determine if kinetic features of UFMRI can differentiate malignant and nonmalignant foci. <b>METHODS</b> - In this single-center retrospective study, consecutive UFMRI examinations performed from July 2019 to April 2023 with subsequent MRI-guided biopsy of a focus were selected. Patient characteristics and lesion features were collected from the EMR, imaging reports, and imaging review. Focus and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) time to enhancement (TTE), and the difference between them was calculated. Associations with malignancy were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. <b>RESULTS</b> - A total of 124 patients (mean age, 53 years old; range, 29-78 years old) underwent biopsy of 124 foci. Sixty-four (51.6%) were postmenopausal, 71 (57.3%) had a personal history of breast cancer, 81 (65.3%) had a family history of breast cancer, and 33/94 (35.3%) had genetic mutations. Most examinations were performed for extent of disease evaluation (47.6%; 59/124), followed by screening (41.9%; 52/124). Patients predominantly had heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue (58.1%; 72/124) and mild BPE (57.3%; 71/124). Of 124 lesions, 21 (16.9%) were malignant, 16 were invasive, and five were ductal carcinoma in situ. Odds of malignancy increased 5% with each 1-second increase in the difference of lesion TTE and BPE TTE (95% CI: 2-9%, p = .006). Older age and lower BPE were associated with increased likelihood of malignancy (p = .005 and p = .02, respectively). Odds of malignancy for patients with minimal or mild BPE were 11.69 times the odds of those with moderate or marked BPE (95% CI: 1.51-90.67). No other demographic or lesion characteristics were predictive of malignancy. <b>CONCLUSION</b> - Earlier visualization of a focus relative to BPE on UFMRI was associated with increased likelihood of malignancy; morphologic features showed no association with malignancy. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT</b> - The difference of TTE of a focus compared with that of BPE may be a useful parameter for assessing malignancy, which could help reduce unnecessary biopsies.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40202353/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=7708173&ff=20250416021922&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40202353</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.24.32309>10.2214/AJR.24.32309</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Helaina C Regen-Tuero","Yiming Gao","Xiaochun Li","Ariella Noorily","Judith D Goldberg","Samantha L Heller"],"dates":["2025-04-09"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40202353","doi:10.2214/AJR.24.32309"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["AJR.

This phenomenon warrants scrutiny given nonradiologists' limited training in imaging interpretation. <b>Objective.</b> To evaluate the frequency of self-interpretation of office-based diagnostic imaging by ordering providers and to assess associations of ordering provider and practice characteristics with self-interpretation, within-practice interpretation, and radiologist interpretation. <b>Methods.</b> This retrospective study used the CMS 5% Research Identifiable File for calendar year 2022 to identify claims for office-based nonbreast diagnostic imaging ordered by nonradiologists for a nationally representative sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Ordering provider and practice characteristics were extracted from the Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty dataset. Self-interpretation, within-practice interpretation, and radiologist interpretation were summarized. Logistic regression models were used to assess associations with self-interpretation and within-practice interpretation for six selected combinations of ordering provider specialty and modality with high imaging volumes. <b>Results.</b> The study included 1,632,212 imaging claims. The unadjusted self-interpretation, within-practice, and radiologist interpretation rates overall were 43.6%, 58.5%, and 36.4%, respectively. The unadjusted self-interpretation rate was 50.4% for radiography and fluoroscopy [XR], 52.0% for ultrasound, 5.3% for CT, 6.1% for MRI, and 39.5% for nuclear medicine. The adjusted odds of self-interpretation were lower for providers with versus without a within-practice radiologist for five of six selected specialty-modality combinations (lowest odds for nonphysician practitioner-ordered XR; OR=0.44), and lower for providers in the largest-sized versus the smallest-sized practices for all selected combinations (lowest odds for orthopedic/sports-ordered MRI; OR=0.01). The adjusted odds of within-practice interpretation were higher for providers in practices with versus without a within-practice radiologist for five of six selected combinations (highest odds for orthopedic/sports-ordered MRI: OR=8.15). Across practice sizes, the unadjusted rate of radiologist interpretation for XR ranged from 15.5-36.2% and 24.9-61.1% for ordering providers in practices with versus without a within-practice radiologist, respectively. <b>Conclusion.</b> Self-interpretation by nonradiologist ordering providers occurred for 43.6% of office-based imaging studies and, in general, was less likely for larger practices or practices with a within-practice radiologist. <b>Clinical Impact.</b> Ongoing healthcare consolidation may partially address the current high rate of imaging self-interpretation by potentially allowing access to a within-practice radiologist.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40172165/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=7708173&ff=20250416021922&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40172165</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.25.32769>10.2214/AJR.25.32769</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Eric W Christensen","Chi-Mei Liu","Elizabeth Y Rula","Vijay M Rao"],"dates":["2025-04-02"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40172165","doi:10.2214/AJR.25.32769"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["AJR.
