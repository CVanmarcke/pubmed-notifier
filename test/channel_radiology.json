Noninvasive methods to quantify ITH are currently limited. Purpose To quantify ITH in breast cancer using pretreatment MRI, develop a nomogram to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and investigate biologic pathways associated with nomogram scores. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC at nine centers between April 1988 and December 2023. Tumor regions on MRI scans were clustered and integrated with global pixel distribution patterns to calculate ITH scores. A nomogram for predicting pCR was developed using multivariable logistic regression. A survival dataset was used to evaluate the association between nomogram score and RFS, and a genomics dataset was used to explore the relationship between nomogram score and biologic pathways. Results The study included 1448 women (median age, 49 years [IQR, 43-54 years]). To predict pCR to NAC, the 505 patients from center A served as the training set, and the patients from center B, centers C-F, and center G served as three external validation sets (<i>n</i> = 331, 107, and 384, respectively). The survival set included patients from centers A and H (<i>n</i> = 179), and the genomics set included patients from center I (<i>n</i> = 74). The ITH score was an independent predictor of pCR (odds ratio, 0.12 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.43]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). The nomogram model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.82, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively, in the three external validation sets. A lower nomogram score was correlated with poorer RFS (hazard ratio, 4.04 [95% CI: 1.90, 8.60]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and was associated with upregulation of biologic pathways related to tumor proliferation. Conclusion A nomogram model combining ITH score and clinicopathologic variables showed good performance in predicting pCR to NAC and RFS.

Semantic search models address this issue, but their development requires scalable methods for generating radiology-specific training data. Purpose To develop a scalable method for training semantic search models for radiology reports and to evaluate a model, RadSearch, trained using this method. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a scalable method for generating training examples for semantic search was applied to CT and MRI reports generated between December 2021 and January 2022, and was used to train the model RadSearch. RadSearch performance was evaluated using four internal test sets (including one subset) and one external test set from another large tertiary medical center, including chest, abdomen, and head CT reports generated between December 2015 and June 2023. Performance was evaluated for findings-to-impression matching, retrieving reports with the same examination type, retrieving reports relevant to free-text queries, and improving the ability of a large language model (LLM) (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) to provide accurate diagnoses from report finding descriptions. RadSearch performance was compared with that of other embedding models specialized for symmetric (All MPNet Base) and asymmetric (MS MARCO DistilBERT Base) semantic search and a state-of-the-art semantic search model (GTE-large). A reference set of 100 diagnoses with common radiologic descriptions was used for the LLM evaluation. Findings-to-impression matching and free-text query accuracy <i>P</i> values were calculated using χ<sup>2</sup> and McNemar tests. Results The training set included 16 690 reports; the internal test sets included 13 598, 6178, and 9954 reports; and the external test set included 13 958 reports. For simulated free-text clinical queries, RadSearch successfully retrieved reports containing the specified findings for 83.0% (498 of 600) of reports and matching location for 89.8% (521 of 580) of reports, outperforming GTE-large, with performance at 65.7% (394 of 600; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and 58.8% (341 of 580; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), respectively. For 100 report finding descriptions, the baseline accuracy of Llama 3.1 8B Instruct in providing the correct diagnosis without any embedding model search assistance was 30% (30 of 100), improving to 61% (61 of 100) with RadSearch integration (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), which outperformed GTE-large integration (47% [47 of 100]; <i>P</i> = .03). Conclusion A semantic search model trained with scalable methods achieved state-of-the-art performance in retrieving reports with relevant findings and improved LLM diagnostic accuracy. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Yasaka and Abe in this issue.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232140/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40232140</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.240686>10.1148/radiol.240686</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Cody H Savage","Gunvant Chaudhari","Andrew D Smith","Jae Ho Sohn"],"dates":["2025-04-15"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40232140","doi:10.1148/radiol.240686"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["RadSearch, a Semantic Search Model for Accurate Radiology Report Retrieval with Large Language Model Integration"],"types":[]}},{"title":"How I Do It: Contrast-enhanced US Applications in Children","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232139/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) allows a detailed assessment of the tissue microvasculature after intravenous injection of contrast material.

The use of CEUS also allows opacification of nonvascular hollow organs and fluid compartments after intracavitary instillation of dilute contrast material. This capability is far beyond that of grayscale and Doppler US techniques. The advantages of CEUS include its ease of use, high safety profile, and absence of ionizing radiation, making it an ideal tool for pediatric imaging. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved CEUS for use in children for characterization of focal liver lesions and diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Because the US contrast agent is distributed throughout the vascular pool, additional off-label imaging studies have focused on a variety of anatomic structures. This review of pediatric CEUS discusses the safety and technical aspects of CEUS, provides practical information on how to perform intravascular and intracavitary examinations, addresses the most common clinical applications of this method, and offers advice regarding the integration of CEUS into pediatric daily clinical practice.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232139/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40232139</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.241544>10.1148/radiol.241544</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Domen Plut","Edward Y Lee","Harriet J Paltiel"],"dates":["2025-04-15"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40232139","doi:10.1148/radiol.241544"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["How I Do It: Contrast-enhanced US Applications in Children"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Intraprotocol Adrenal Vein Sampling Inconsistencies in Primary Aldosteronism Lateralization","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232138/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Background Primary aldosteronism can arise from one or both adrenal glands.

Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the standard of care for identifying patients with lateralized primary aldosteronism who would benefit from surgery. Variability in AVS lateralization has been primarily attributed to cosyntropin use and lateralization index thresholds. Data regarding intraprotocol variability are lacking. Purpose To assess the rates of intraprotocol lateralization inconsistency during simultaneous AVS. Materials and Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study assessed patients with primary aldosteronism who underwent simultaneous AVS at a single tertiary referral center between January 2015 and December 2023. Six sets of adrenal vein and peripheral vein samples were obtained: three baseline samples obtained after cannulation, 5 minutes apart; and three samples obtained between 5 and 30 minutes after cosyntropin stimulation. Patients with successful cannulation and valid hormonal data at all six time points were included. A lateralization index (computed as the aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio between the two adrenal veins, with the highest number as numerator) of at least 4 was considered indicative of lateralized primary aldosteronism. The proportions of baseline and stimulated AVS sets within which one of three lateralization indexes provided different subtype results were assessed. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the between- and within-patient hormonal and lateralization index variances. Results Of 402 patients (median age, 53 years; IQR, 45-63 years; 233 male) included, 129 patients (32.1%) had at least one lateralization index inconsistency. Of these 402 patients, 89 patients (22.1%) had lateralization inconsistencies within the baseline sets, 53 patients (13.2%) within cosyntropin-stimulated sets, and 13 patients (3.2%) in both baseline and cosyntropin-stimulated sets. The highest outlier prevalence occurred in the first (42 patients; 10.4%) and third (33 patients; 8.2%) baseline samples, with roughly twofold-lower rates in the first (23 patients; 5.7%) and last postcosyntropin stimulation samples (4.2%; 17 patients). The absolute change in baseline and cosyntropin-stimulated lateralization index (maximum-minimum lateralization index within a triplicate) was as high as 152.9 and 327.4, respectively. The highest hormonal variability was noted in the adrenal vein producing less aldosterone. Conclusion Almost a third of patients undergoing AVS in triplicate, both before and after cosyntropin stimulation, had intraprotocol discrepancies in lateralization results, with the highest variability occurring within samples obtained without cosyntropin stimulation. © RSNA, 2025 See also the editorial by Georgiades in this issue.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a

Specific data and performance metric requirements and a checklist are provided for this use case. Data requirements emphasize the need for sufficient information to provide transparency and characterization of training and test data. The definition of a true-negative examination (which includes a minimum of 2-year follow-up), the need for image quality assessments, and nonimaging metadata requirements are provided. Performance metrics ranges are included, such as a cancer detection rate of 40%-70% for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, or PI-RADS, 4 or higher lesions and demonstration of equivalent or better than human performance using receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. The use of open datasets such as those used in the AI challenge model is encouraged. The study design should include conformity with the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging requirements. This article should be taken in the context of the current and evolving regulatory landscape. This review provides guidance based on subspeciality expertise in prostate MRI and will hopefully accelerate the clinical translation of AI in PCa detection.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232134/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40232134</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.240140>10.1148/radiol.240140</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Baris Turkbey","Henkjan Huisman","Andriy Fedorov","Katarzyna J Macura","Daniel J Margolis","Valeria Panebianco","Aytekin Oto","Ivo G Schoots","M Minhaj Siddiqui","Caroline M Moore","Olivier Rouvière","Leonardo K Bittencourt","Anwar R Padhani","Clare M Tempany","Masoom A Haider"],"dates":["2025-04-15"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40232134","doi:10.1148/radiol.240140"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Requirements for AI Development and Reporting for MRI Prostate Cancer Detection in Biopsy-Naive Men: PI-RADS Steering Committee, Version 1.0"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Angiofibroma of Soft Tissue in the Liver","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197100/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"No abstract","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40197100","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\"><b>Radiology</b>. 2025 Apr;315(1):e242524. doi: 10.1148/radiol.242524.</p><p><b>NO ABSTRACT</b></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197100/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40197100</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.242524>10.1148/radiol.242524</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Xi Jia","Mengsu Zeng"],"dates":["2025-04-08"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40197100","doi:10.1148/radiol.242524"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Angiofibroma of Soft Tissue in the Liver"],"types":[]}},{"title":"CT Lymph Node Patterns in MSI-High Colon Cancer: A Potential Solution to a Mystery","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197099/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"No abstract","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40197099","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\"><b>Radiology</b>. 2025 Apr;315(1):e250556. doi: 10.1148/radiol.250556.</p><p><b>NO ABSTRACT</b></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197099/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40197099</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.250556>10.1148/radiol.250556</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Naama Lev-Cohain","Jacob Sosna"],"dates":["2025-04-08"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40197099","doi:10.1148/radiol.250556"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["CT Lymph Node Patterns in MSI-High Colon Cancer: A Potential Solution to a Mystery"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Deep Learning Applications in Imaging of Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Narrative Summary","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197098/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, requiring swift and precise clinical decisions based on neuroimaging.

Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision and language artificial intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated transformative performance for several stroke-related applications. Purpose To evaluate deep learning applications for imaging in AIS in adult patients, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the technology and identifying opportunities for advancement. Materials and Methods A systematic literature review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive search of four databases from January 2016 to January 2024 was performed, targeting deep learning applications for imaging of AIS, including automated detection of large vessel occlusion and measurement of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on convolutional neural networks and transformers. The top-represented areas were addressed, and the relevant information was extracted and summarized. Results Of 380 studies included, 171 (45.0%) focused on stroke lesion segmentation, 129 (33.9%) on classification and triage, 31 (8.2%) on outcome prediction, 15 (3.9%) on generative AI and large language models, and 11 (2.9%) on rapid or low-dose imaging specific to stroke applications. Detailed data extraction was performed for 68 studies. Public AIS datasets are also highlighted, for researchers developing AI models for stroke imaging. Conclusion Deep learning applications have permeated AIS imaging, particularly for stroke lesion segmentation. However, challenges remain, including the need for standardized protocols and test sets, larger public datasets, and performance validation in real-world settings. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197098/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40197098</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.240775>10.1148/radiol.240775</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Bin Jiang","Nancy Pham","Eric K van Staalduinen","Yongkai Liu","Sanaz Nazari-Farsani","Amirhossein Sanaat","Henk van Voorst","Ates Fettahoglu","Donghoon Kim","Jiahong Ouyang","Ashwin Kumar","Aditya Srivatsan","Ramy Hussein","Maarten G Lansberg","Fernando Boada","Greg Zaharchuk"],"dates":["2025-04-08"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40197098","doi:10.1148/radiol.240775"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Deep Learning Applications in Imaging of Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Narrative Summary"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Breast Cancer Detection with Standalone AI versus Radiologist Interpretation of Unilateral Surveillance Mammography after Mastectomy","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197097/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Background Limited data are available regarding the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms trained on bilateral mammograms for second breast cancer surveillance in patients with a personal history of breast cancer treated with unilateral mastectomy.

Purpose To compare the performance of standalone AI for second breast cancer surveillance on unilateral mammograms with that of radiologists reading mammograms without AI assistance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective institutional database study, patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2001 and December 2018 and underwent postmastectomy surveillance mammography from January 2011 to March 2023 were included. Radiologists' mammogram interpretations without AI assistance were collected from these records and compared with AI interpretations of the same mammograms. The reference standards were histologic examination and 1-year follow-up data. The cancer detection rate per 1000 screening examinations, sensitivity, and specificity of standalone AI and the radiologists' interpretations without AI were compared using the McNemar test. Results Among the 4184 asymptomatic female patients (mean age, 52 years), 111 (2.7%) had contralateral second breast cancer. The cancer detection rate (17.4 per 1000 examinations [73 of 4184]; 95% CI: 13.7, 21.9) and sensitivity (65.8% [73 of 111]; 95% CI: 56.2, 74.5) were greater for standalone AI than for radiologists (14.6 per 1000 examinations [61 of 4184]; 95% CI: 11.2, 18.7; <i>P</i> = .01; 55.0% [61 of 111]; 95% CI: 45.2, 64.4; <i>P</i> = .01). The specificity was lower for standalone AI than for radiologists (91.5% [3725 of 4073]; 95% CI: 90.6, 92.3 vs 98.1% [3996 of 4073]; 95% CI: 97.6, 98.5; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). AI detected 16 of 50 (32%) cancers missed by radiologists; however, 34 of 111 (30.6%) breast cancers were missed by both radiologists and AI. Conclusion Standalone AI for surveillance mammography showed higher sensitivity with lower specificity for contralateral breast cancer detection in patients treated with unilateral mastectomy than radiologists without AI assistance. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Philpotts in this issue.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197097/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40197097</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.242955>10.1148/radiol.242955</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Su Min Ha","Janie M Lee","Myoung-Jin Jang","Hong-Kyu Kim","Jung Min Chang"],"dates":["2025-04-08"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40197097","doi:10.1148/radiol.242955"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Breast Cancer Detection with Standalone AI versus Radiologist Interpretation of Unilateral Surveillance Mammography after Mastectomy"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Parallel Detection of Multicontrast MRI and Deuterium Metabolic Imaging for Time-efficient Characterization of Neurologic Diseases","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197096/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Background Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) is a novel, MRI-based method to map metabolism noninvasively in vivo and has potential to augment existing clinical MRI with unique metabolic information.

However, adding DMI scans to a standard, clinical MRI protocol is challenging due to the relatively long scan time of DMI that can result in decreased patient compliance and increased scanning costs. Purpose To design and evaluate a parallel acquisition strategy, based on the large frequency difference between hydrogen proton (<sup>1</sup>H) and deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) MRI signals, to obtain metabolic DMI data during a comprehensive, multicontrast (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] and T1-, T2-, and susceptibility-weighted) MRI protocol without adding scanning time. Materials and Methods A parallel MRI DMI protocol based on four essential MRI types-FLAIR, and T1-, T2-, and susceptibility-weighted MRI-was interwoven with three-dimensional DMI by executing <sup>2</sup>H acquisition blocks during the contrast-generating delays intrinsic to MRI. Results Phantom and in vivo human brain data show that MRI scan quality, DMI sensitivity, and information content are preserved in the parallel MRI DMI acquisition method. DMI data acquired in parallel with MRI in a patient with an astrocytoma show unique metabolic image contrast that complements the multicontrast MRI examinations. Conclusion Parallel MRI scan acquisition technology was a practical solution to obtain both high-quality anatomic and metabolic scans without prolonging the scanning duration compared with an MRI-only protocol; the method had high flexibility to upgrade traditional MRI protocols with DMI and will be key for many clinical sites to gain access to DMI and drive its further development and validation by use in larger, diverse patient populations. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article</i>.

Purpose To determine whether CT-detected lymph node distribution patterns can improve lymph node evaluation in MSI-H colon cancer. Materials and Methods This two-center retrospective study included patients with MSI-H colon cancer who underwent pretreatment CT and radical surgery (development set, December 2017-December 2022; test set, January 2016-January 2024). Lymph node characteristics associated with pathologic lymph node metastasis (pN+), including clinical lymph node stage (cN) and distribution patterns (vascular distribution, jammed cluster, and partial fusion), were selected (logistic regression and Kendall tau-b correlation) to create a distribution-based clinical lymph node stage (dcN) in the development set. Diagnostic performance was verified in the test set. Interobserver agreement was assessed by using Fleiss κ. Clinical value of dcN was assessed using univariable logistic analysis among patients in the treatment set receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy (August 2017-February 2024). Results The study included 368 patients (median age, 60 years [IQR, 50-70 years]; 211 male): 230 from the development set (median age, 59 years [IQR, 49-70 years]), 86 from the test set (median age, 66 years [IQR, 55-79 years]), and 52 from the treatment set (median age, 54 years [IQR, 42-65 years]). Only jammed cluster and partial fusion were associated with higher odds of pN+ (odds ratio, 78.9 and 21.5, respectively; both <i>P</i> &lt; .001). dcN outperformed cN in the test set (accuracy, 90% [78 of 87] vs 46% [40 of 87]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001; specificity, 97% [55 of 57] vs 26% [15 of 57]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Interobserver agreement was moderate for dcN (κ = 0.67) and poor for cN (κ = 0.48). dcN was associated with a complete response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy (odds ratio, 0.05; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Conclusion dcN showed high performance for identifying regional lymph node metastases and helped predict complete response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy in MSI-H colon cancer using a surgical reference standard. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Lev-Cohain and Sosna in this issue.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197093/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40197093</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.242122>10.1148/radiol.242122</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Zhen Guan","Zheng-Hang Wang","Xiao-Yan Zhang","Shuo Yan","Ting Xu","Jian Li","Lin Shen","Ying-Shi Sun"],"dates":["2025-04-08"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40197093","doi:10.1148/radiol.242122"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Predicting Regional Lymph Node Metastases at CT in Microsatellite Instability-High Colon Cancer"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Comparison of Deuterium Metabolic Imaging with FDG PET in Alzheimer Disease","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40197092/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Background The approval of amyloid-targeting therapies has made it increasingly important to differentiate Alzheimer disease (AD) from other causes of dementia.

Dysfunctional glucose metabolism is a recognized pathophysiological element in AD that may be visualized with spectroscopic MRI of deuterated glucose and its metabolites, also known as deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI). Purpose To explore the potential of DMI as a diagnostic tool for AD. Materials and Methods In this prospective cross-sectional study, participants with newly diagnosed AD and age-matched controls were recruited from April to October 2023. DMI was performed with a 3-T system equipped with a proton/deuterium head coil following oral consumption of 75 g of deuterated glucose. Clinical fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET data were acquired from patient records for comparison. The predefined primary outcome, the ratio between lactate and glutamine plus glutamate (Glx) at DMI, was analyzed using age-corrected linear mixed-effect models. Results Ten participants with AD (mean age, 72 years ± 6 [SD]; six women) and five age-matched healthy controls (mean age, 68 years ± 7; four men) were included. The primary analysis revealed no evidence of a difference in the ratio of lactate to Glx between participants with AD and controls (<i>P</i> = .24 across all regions of interest). Exploratory analyses revealed that participants with AD had reduced signals for medial temporal lactate (0.7 ± 0.2 vs 0.5 ± 0.1, <i>P</i> = .04) and Glx (0.5 ± 0.03 vs 0.48 ± 0.05, <i>P</i> = .03) compared with controls. Finally, a strong correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.73) was observed between DMI and FDG PET. Conclusion This study did not find evidence to support a shift from oxidative to anaerobic metabolism in AD. Exploratory analyses revealed a decrease in glucose metabolism in the medial temporal lobe. In extension hereof, a similar distribution of low DMI metabolism and decreased FDG PET glucose uptake was observed. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the article by Liu et al in this issue.

DCIS is often overtreated, necessitating robust models for improved risk stratification. Purpose To develop logistic regression models using clinical and MRI-based radiomic features of DCIS and to evaluate the performance of such models in predicting disease upstaging at surgery and DCIS score. Materials and Methods This study is a secondary analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network, or ECOG-ACRIN, E4112 trial. Primary analysis focused on predicting disease upstaging (<i>n</i> = 295), and secondary analysis focused on predicting DCIS score (<i>n</i> = 174). Radiologist-drawn lesion segmentations and publicly available Cancer Phenomics Toolkit, or CaPTk, software was used to compute 65 radiomic features. Participants were clustered into groups based on their radiomic features (ie, radiomic phenotypes), and principal component analysis was used to summarize the feature space. Clinical information and qualitative MRI features were available. Associations were tested using χ<sup>2</sup> and likelihood ratio tests. Data were split into training and test sets with a 3:2 ratio, and model performance was assessed on the test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Data from 297 female participants with median age of 60 years (IQR, 51-67 years) were analyzed. Two radiomic phenotypes were identified that were associated with disease upstaging (<i>P</i> = .007). For predicting disease upstaging, the top three radiomic principal components combined with clinical and qualitative MRI predictors yielded the highest AUC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.88) among all tested models (<i>P</i> = .007), identifying 25% more true-negative (49 of 93 true-negative findings, 53% specificity) findings, compared with using clinical information alone (23 of 93 true-negative findings, 28% specificity). Radiomic models were not predictive of the DCIS score (<i>P</i> &gt; .05). Conclusion In patients with DCIS, combining radiomic metrics with clinical information improved prediction of disease upstaging but not DCIS score.

Purpose To measure liver mechanical property heterogeneity using MR elastography (MRE) and evaluate its potential as a biomarker for tissue inflammation and fibrosis in patients with MASLD. Materials and Methods Mechanical tissue heterogeneity in MASLD was assessed at three-dimensional vector MRE pixel-wise histogram analysis of shear stiffness and loss modulus in preclinical and clinical studies. The preclinical study involved 25 rats that were examined monthly, whereas the clinical study analyzed data from 179 participants across two prospective studies (September 2015 to November 2022), including some who underwent bariatric surgery at pretreatment and posttreatment MRE examinations. Mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of shear stiffness and loss modulus were calculated for each examination. Nonparametric tests and Spearman correlation coefficient were used to compare MRE-derived tissue mechanics with biopsy-confirmed fibrosis and inflammation and assess correlations with portal pressure and histopathologic hepatic fibrosis. Results The preclinical study showed that, in cirrhotic livers, CV of loss modulus positively correlated with portal pressure and fibrosis area ratio variation (ρ = 0.52 [<i>P</i> = .008] and 0.55 [<i>P</i> = .005], respectively). The clinical study showed that, in 10 healthy volunteers (median age, 36.5 years; IQR, 34.0-38.8 years; five females) and 169 participants with MASLD (median age, 50.1 years; IQR, 41.0-58.2 years; 118 females), CV of sheer stiffness (from 0.12 to 0.30 in healthy participants to participants with stage 4 fibrosis) and loss modulus (from 0.31 to 0.51 in healthy participants to participants with grade 3 inflammation) increased with increasing severity of fibrosis and inflammation, respectively. In 36 participants who underwent bariatric surgery, the CV of sheer stiffness decreased at the 1-year follow-up, from 0.16 (IQR, 0.14-0.18) to 0.14 (IQR, 0.12-0.16) (<i>P</i> = .009). Conclusion Tissue mechanical heterogeneity assessed at MRE positively correlated with progression of MASLD, demonstrating potential as a biomarker for liver disease severity and therapeutic intervention.

However, the relationship between neuroimaging markers, the cumulative severity of injury, and long-term symptoms has not previously been well-established in the literature. Purpose To determine the relationship between the frequency of blast injuries, persistent clinical symptoms, and related cortical volumetric and functional connectivity (FC) changes observed at brain MRI in special operations forces members. Materials and Methods A cohort of 220 service members from a prospective study between January 2021 and May 2023 with a history of repetitive blast exposure underwent psychodiagnostics and a comprehensive neuroimaging evaluation, including structural and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Of these, 212 met the inclusion criteria. Participants were split into two datasets for model development and validation, and each dataset was divided into high- and low-exposure groups based on participants' exposure to various explosives. Differences in FC were analyzed using a general linear model, and cortical gray matter volumes were compared using the Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test. An external age- and sex-matched healthy control group of 212 participants was extracted from the SRPBS Multidisorder MRI Dataset for volumetric analyses. A multiple linear regression model was used to assess correlations between clinical scores and FC, while a logistic regression model was used to predict exposure group from fMRI scans. Results In the 212 participants (mean age, 43.0 years ± 8.6 [SD]; 160 male [99.5%]) divided into groups with low or high blast exposure, the high-exposure group had higher scores for the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) (<i>t</i> = 3.16, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (Fifth Edition) (PCL-5) (<i>t</i> = 2.72, <i>P</i> = .01). FC differences were identified in the bilateral superior and inferior lateral occipital cortex (LOC) (<i>P</i> value range, .001-.04), frontal medial cortex (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), left superior frontal gyrus (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and precuneus (<i>P</i> value range, .02-.03). Clinical scores from NSI and PCL-5 were inversely correlated with FC in the LOC, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, and default mode networks (<i>r</i> = -0.163 to -0.384; <i>P</i> value range, &lt;.001 to .04). The high-exposure group showed increased cortical volume in regions of the LOC compared with healthy controls and the low-exposure group (<i>P</i> value range, .01-.04). The predictive model helped accurately classify participants into high- and low-exposure groups based on fMRI data with 88.00 sensitivity (95% CI: 78.00, 98.00), 67% specificity (95% CI: 53.00, 81.00), and 73% accuracy (95% CI: 60.00, 86.00). Conclusion Repetitive blast exposure leads to distinct alterations in FC and cortical volume, which correlate with neurobehavioral symptoms. The predictive model suggests that even in the absence of observable anatomic changes, FC may indicate blast-related trauma. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167438/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40167438</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.233264>10.1148/radiol.233264</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Andrea Diociasi","Mary A Iaccarino","Scott Sorg","Emily J Lubin","Caroline Wisialowski","Amol Dua","Can Ozan Tan","Rajiv Gupta"],"dates":["2025-04-01"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40167438","doi:10.1148/radiol.233264"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Distinct Functional MRI Connectivity Patterns and Cortical Volume Variations Associated with Repetitive Blast Exposure in Special Operations Forces Members"],"types":[]}},{"title":"The Updated ACR Manual on MR Safety and How It Will Affect Your Practice","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167437/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"No abstract","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40167437","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\"><b>Radiology</b>. 2025 Apr;315(1):e242954. doi: 10.1148/radiol.242954.</p><p><b>NO ABSTRACT</b></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167437/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40167437</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.242954>10.1148/radiol.242954</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Emanuel Kanal"],"dates":["2025-04-01"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40167437","doi:10.1148/radiol.242954"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["The Updated ACR Manual on MR Safety and How It Will Affect Your Practice"],"types":[]}},{"title":"American College of Radiology Manual on MR Safety: 2024 Update and Revisions","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167436/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Since the introduction of the American College of Radiology (ACR) MRI safety guidelines in 2002, the indications for use of MRI in clinical care and research have continued to expand.

Similarly, MRI technologies have evolved, with multiple field strengths now available for human imaging. While several publications have updated the ACR recommendations since the first guidelines, a single source in a structured format was lacking. Accordingly, the ACR Committee on MR Safety recently updated the online ACR Manual on MR Safety that compiles ACR recommendations for safe use of MRI equipment in humans into a single document. This review describes the new structure of the ACR Manual on MR Safety, discusses new content, indicates gaps in knowledge that require further research, and explains the rationale for the Committee

Automatic assignment of O-RADS scores from reports could increase adoption and accuracy. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), after strategic optimization, for automatically calculating O-RADS scores from reports. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study from a large quaternary care cancer center included consecutive gadolinium chelate-enhanced pelvic MRI reports with at least one assigned O-RADS score from July 2021 to October 2023. Reports from January 2018 to October 2019 (before O-RADS MRI implementation) were randomly selected for additional testing. Reference standard O-RADS scores were determined by radiologists interpreting reports. After prompt optimization using a subset of reports, two LLM-based strategies were evaluated: few-shot learning with GPT-4 (version 0613; OpenAI) prompted with O-RADS rules (\"LLM only\") and a hybrid strategy leveraging GPT-4 to classify features fed into a deterministic formula (\"hybrid\"). Accuracy of each model and originally reported scores were calculated and compared using the McNemar test. Results A total of 284 reports from 284 female patients (mean age, 53.2 years ± 16.3 [SD]) with 372 adnexal lesions were included: 10 reports in the training set (16 lesions), 134 reports in the internal test set 1 (173 lesions; 158 O-RADS assigned), and 140 reports in internal test set 2 (183 lesions). For assigning O-RADS MRI scores, the hybrid model accuracy (97%; 168 of 173) outperformed LLM-only model (90%; 155 of 173; <i>P</i> = .006). For lesions with an originally reported O-RADS score, hybrid model accuracy exceeded that of reporting radiologists (97% [153 of 158] vs 88% [139 of 158]; <i>P</i> = .004). Hybrid model also outperformed LLM-only model for 183 lesions from before O-RADS implementation (95% [173 of 183] vs 87% [159 of 183], respectively; <i>P</i> = .01). Conclusion A hybrid LLM-based application, combining LLM feature classification with deterministic elements, accurately assigned O-RADS MRI scores from report descriptions, exceeding both an LLM-only strategy and the original reporting radiologist. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167432/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40167432</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.241554>10.1148/radiol.241554</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Rajesh Bhayana","Ankush Jajodia","Tanya Chawla","Yangqing Deng","Genevieve Bouchard-Fortier","Masoom Haider","Satheesh Krishna"],"dates":["2025-04-01"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40167432","doi:10.1148/radiol.241554"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Accuracy of Large Language Model-based Automatic Calculation of Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System MRI Scores from Pelvic MRI Reports"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Spatial Viscoelastic Information in Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167431/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"No abstract","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40167431","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\"><b>Radiology</b>. 2025 Apr;315(1):e250559. doi: 10.1148/radiol.250559.</p><p><b>NO ABSTRACT</b></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167431/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40167431</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.250559>10.1148/radiol.250559</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Guilherme Moura Cunha"],"dates":["2025-04-01"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40167431","doi:10.1148/radiol.250559"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Spatial Viscoelastic Information in Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Accuracy of Dual-Energy CT-derived Fat Maps and Bone Marrow Edema Maps in Pedal Osteomyelitis Diagnosis","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167430/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"\"Just Accepted\" papers have undergone full peer review and have been accepted for publication in Radiology.

Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of additional bone marrow fat maps with that of DECT with BME maps and MRI for pedal osteomyelitis detection. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, thirty-one participants with clinically suspected osteomyelitis of the mid- and forefoot underwent noncontrast DECT (80 kV/140 kV) and MRI between October 2020 and February 2022. With image postprocessing, DECT-derived BME and fat maps were generated. Four independent readers evaluated 3 different image sets for osteomyelitis: DECT and BME maps (set 1); DECT, BME maps and fat maps (set 2); and MRI (set 3). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for each image set, with clinical and microbiological data as the reference standards. In a subanalysis, the DECT BME map, DECT fat map and DECT erosion map were analyzed for their accuracy in predicting bone marrow fat loss at T1-weighted MRI. Results Of the 31 participants included in the study (mean age, 61.7 years ±14.6 [SD]; 21 males) 17 (55%) had osteomyelitis. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting osteomyelitis were 47% (8/17), 79% (11/14), and 61% (19/31) (set 1); 77% (13/17), 86% (12/14) and 81% (25/31) (set 2); and 82% (14/17), 93% (13/14) and 87% (27/31) (set 3), respectively. Thirty-one of 661 individual bones (0.5%) showed bone marrow fat loss on T1-weighted MRI; in the subanalysis, DECT fat map specificity was higher than that of the DECT BME map for predicting bone marrow fat loss in individual bones (97% (612/630) vs. 89% (560/630)) (P&lt;.001). Conclusion Pedal osteomyelitis detection with novel DECT-derived fat map imaging in addition to DECT and BME maps was accurate.

Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS category 5 (LR-5, indicating definite HCC) observations for HCC using CT and MRI in patients with noncirrhotic CHC and to compare these findings with those in patients with cirrhotic CHC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients without cirrhosis with CHC with focal hepatic nodules of 1 cm or greater on dynamic CT or MRI scans who underwent pathologic confirmation at two university hospitals from August 2002 to February 2022. This group served as the test dataset. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of LR-5 for HCC using CT and MRI. When LI-RADS categorization differed between CT and MRI, the MRI-based classification was used as the definitive category. Results were validated using a dataset of patients with CHC from two additional hospitals based on the clinical composite reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Results The test dataset comprised 458 patients (mean age, 64 years ± 9 [SD]; 350 male; 219 without cirrhosis, 239 with cirrhosis). For noncirrhotic livers, the LR-5 criteria achieved an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.93), 85.1% (95% CI: 80.6, 89.7), 82.4% (95% CI: 77.0, 87.8), 97.6% (95% CI: 93.0, 100.0), 99.4% (95% CI: 98.2, 100.0), and 54.7% (95% CI: 43.4, 65.9), respectively. The AUC for LR-5 observations in diagnosing HCC was higher in the noncirrhotic liver group compared with the cirrhotic liver group (AUC, 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.93] vs 0.79 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.84]; <i>P</i> = .002). The diagnostic performance of the LR-5 criteria for diagnosing HCC was also excellent in patients with noncirrhotic CHC in the validation dataset, which included 155 lesions from 103 patients (mean age, 68 years ± 12; 146 male). The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV in the validation dataset were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97), 96.1% (95% CI: 93.1, 99.2), 82.9% (95% CI: 70.4, 95.3), 100%, 100%, and 95.2% (95% CI: 91.5, 99.0), respectively. Conclusion The diagnostic performance of LR-5 for HCC in patients with noncirrhotic CHC was comparable to that in patients with cirrhosis across various clinical settings. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Schöllnast in this issue.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131114/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40131114</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.241856>10.1148/radiol.241856</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Jihyun An","Rohee Park","Euichang Kim","Seong Kyun Na","Ha Il Kim","In-Hye Song","Young Seo Cho","Ji Hun Kang","Han Chu Lee","Seungbong Han","Jean-Charles Nault","Sang Hyun Choi","Ju Hyun Shim"],"dates":["2025-03-25"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40131114","doi:10.1148/radiol.241856"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["LI-RADS for Diagnosing Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Noncirrhotic Chronic Hepatitis C"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica of Humerus and Glenoid","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131113/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"No abstract","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40131113","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\"><b>Radiology</b>. 2025 Mar;314(3):e241712. doi: 10.1148/radiol.241712.</p><p><b>NO ABSTRACT</b></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131113/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40131113</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.241712>10.1148/radiol.241712</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Chia-Hui Chen","Chien-Kuo Wang"],"dates":["2025-03-25"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40131113","doi:10.1148/radiol.241712"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica of Humerus and Glenoid"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Case 335: Accidental Intra-Arterial Injection of Contrast Material","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131112/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"An 84-year-old female patient presented for routine CT angiography (CTA) of the arteries of the neck following right carotid endarterectomy for 75% stenosis, which had been performed without incident 2 months prior.

Purpose To develop and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical value of a domain-specific multimodal generative AI model for providing preliminary interpretations of chest radiographs. Materials and Methods For training, consecutive radiograph-report pairs from frontal chest radiography were retrospectively collected from 42 hospitals (2005-2023). The trained domain-specific AI model generated radiology reports for the radiographs. The test set included public datasets (PadChest, Open-i, VinDr-CXR, and MIMIC-CXR-JPG) and radiographs excluded from training. The sensitivity and specificity of the model-generated reports for 13 radiographic findings, compared with radiologist annotations (reference standard), were calculated (with 95% CIs). Four radiologists evaluated the subjective quality of the reports in terms of acceptability, agreement score, quality score, and comparative ranking of reports from <i>(a)</i> the domain-specific AI model, <i>(b)</i> radiologists, and <i>(c)</i> a general-purpose large language model (GPT-4Vision). Acceptability was defined as whether the radiologist would endorse the report as their own without changes. Agreement scores from 1 (clinically significant discrepancy) to 5 (complete agreement) were assigned using RADPEER; quality scores were on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). Results A total of 8 838 719 radiograph-report pairs (training) and 2145 radiographs (testing) were included (anonymized with respect to sex and gender). Reports generated by the domain-specific AI model demonstrated high sensitivity for detecting two critical radiographic findings: 95.3% (181 of 190) for pneumothorax and 92.6% (138 of 149) for subcutaneous emphysema. Acceptance rate, evaluated by four radiologists, was 70.5% (6047 of 8680), 73.3% (6288 of 8580), and 29.6% (2536 of 8580) for model-generated, radiologist, and GPT-4Vision reports, respectively. Agreement scores were highest for the model-generated reports (median = 4 [IQR, 3-5]) and lowest for GPT-4Vision reports (median = 1 [IQR, 1-3]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Quality scores were also highest for the model-generated reports (median = 4 [IQR, 3-5]) and lowest for the GPT-4Vision reports (median = 2 [IQR, 1-3]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). From the ranking analysis, model-generated reports were most frequently ranked the highest (60.0%; 5146 of 8580), and GPT-4Vision reports were most frequently ranked the lowest (73.6%; 6312 of 8580).

The spatial extent (\"fill state\") of these three hallmark pathologic abnormalities may serve as critical pathophysiologic information, pending further investigation. Purpose To examine the clinical utility and increase the accessibility of PET-derived fill states. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of two prospective studies used data from two independent cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Tau Propagation over Time study (T-POT). Each cohort comprised amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals (controls) and patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or probable-AD dementia. Fill states of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration were computed as the percentages of significantly abnormal voxels relative to controls across PET scans. Fill states and SUV ratios were compared across stages (Kruskal-Wallis <i>H</i> test, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) and tested for association with the severity of cognitive impairment (Spearman correlation, multivariate regression analysis). Additionally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to estimate fill states from patients' PET scans without requiring controls. Results The ADNI cohort included 324 individuals (mean age, 72 years ± 6.8 [SD]; 173 [53%] female), and the T-POT cohort comprised 99 individuals (mean age, 66 years ± 8.7; 63 [64%] female). Higher fill states were associated with higher stages of cognitive impairment (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and tau and neurodegeneration fill states showed higher diagnostic performance for cognitive impairment compared with SUV ratio (<i>P</i> &lt; .05) across cohorts. Similarly, all fill states were negatively correlated with cognitive performance (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and uniquely characterized the degree of cognitive impairment even after adjustment for SUV ratio (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). The CNN estimated amyloid and tau accurately, but not neurodegeneration fill states. Conclusion Fill states provided reliable markers of AD progression, potentially improving early detection, staging, and monitoring of AD in clinical practice and trials beyond SUV ratio.

However, its effectiveness in sealing ventral dural tears, particularly in chronic cases with organized spinal longitudinal extradural collections (SLECs), is not well documented. Purpose To assess the efficacy of intra-SLEC patching compared with traditional patching for treatment of ventral dural tears. Materials and Methods This two-site retrospective cross-sectional study conducted between January 2019 and July 2024 included patients with SIH due to a ventral dural tear who underwent epidural patching. Organized SLECs, characterized by sharply demarcated, convex edges and confined to the ventral epidural space, were distinguished from unorganized SLECs, which show fluid distribution in both ventral and dorsal spaces. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the complication rate between treatment groups, and the χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the proportion of patients with SLEC resolution between treatment groups. Results Fifty-two patients (mean age, 44.9 years ± 9.5 [SD]; 30 male patients) were included; before treatment, 39 had organized SLECs and 13 had unorganized SLECs. Overall, 25% (13 of 52) of patients had SLEC resolution after treatment. Organized SLECs were less likely to resolve than unorganized SLECs (six of 39 [15%] vs seven of 13 [54%]; <i>P</i> = .02). In patients with organized SLECs, intra-SLEC patching had a higher success rate (33%; five of 15) than traditional patching (4%; one of 24; <i>P</i> = .046). Multivariable analysis showed that intra-SLEC patching (odds ratio, 13.24 [95% CI: 1, 149]; <i>P</i> = .04) and unorganized SLECs (odds ratio, 21.47 [95% CI: 2, 216]; <i>P</i> = .009) were associated with higher odds of SLEC resolution. Conclusion In 25% of patients with SIH, MRI performed after epidural blood patching showed resolution of the SLEC. Intra-SLEC patching was more effective than traditional patching for treating organized SLECs. © RSNA, 2025 See also the editorial by Urbach in this issue.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131109/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40131109</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.242194>10.1148/radiol.242194</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Andrew L Callen","Samantha L Pisani Petrucci","Peter Lennarson","Mark F Sedrak","Adriana Gutierrez","Mark D Mamlouk"],"dates":["2025-03-25"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40131109","doi:10.1148/radiol.242194"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Efficacy of Traditional Epidural Patching versus Patching within Spinal Longitudinal Extradural Collections for Ventral Dural Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Imaging-based Hepatocellular Carcinoma Diagnosis: An Extension of LI-RADS to Patients with Noncirrhotic Hepatitis C","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131108/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"No abstract","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40131108","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\"><b>Radiology</b>. 2025 Mar;314(3):e250627. doi: 10.1148/radiol.250627.</p><p><b>NO ABSTRACT</b></p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131108/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40131108</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.250627>10.1148/radiol.250627</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Helmut Schöllnast"],"dates":["2025-03-25"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40131108","doi:10.1148/radiol.250627"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Imaging-based Hepatocellular Carcinoma Diagnosis: An Extension of LI-RADS to Patients with Noncirrhotic Hepatitis C"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Evaluation of Autoimmune Features in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Pathologic Usual Interstitial Pneumonia: Implications for CT Patterns and Prognosis","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40131107/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"Background The clinical, radiologic, and prognostic implications of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and pathologic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) have not been fully evaluated.

Purpose To compare autoimmune features according to CT patterns for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to assess the diagnostic and prognostic implications of IPAF in patients with IPF-UIP. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with UIP confirmed by surgical lung biopsy between January 2013 and February 2020. Data regarding clinical, radiologic, and pathologic autoimmune features were collected, and patients were diagnosed with IPAF according to current guidelines. CT signs for connective tissue disease (CTD; anterior upper lobe, straightedge, and exuberant honeycombing signs) were also evaluated. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results Among 210 patients included (median age, 64 years; IQR, 60-68 years; 158 male patients), 23 (11.0%) had IPAF. Patients with an alternative diagnosis or CT pattern indeterminate for UIP showed a higher prevalence of autoimmune features that were pathologic (38% [33 of 87] vs 20.3% [25 of 123]; <i>P</i> = .005) and serologic (20% [17 of 87] vs 9.8% [12 of 123]; <i>P</i> = .04) and IPAF (4.1% [five of 123] vs 21% [18 of 87]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) compared with patients with UIP or probable UIP pattern. However, IPAF was not predictive of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.72; <i>P</i> = .58). Lymphoid follicles (HR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.93; <i>P</i> = .02), CT signs for CTD (HR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.99; <i>P</i> = .047), and use of an antifibrotic agent (HR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.51; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) were independently associated with higher OS, and greater extent of fibrosis on CT scans was associated with worse OS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.11; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Conclusion In patients with IPF-pathologic UIP, serologic and pathologic autoimmune features were associated with indeterminate or alternative CT patterns. Certain histopathologic and radiologic autoimmune features, but not current IPAF criteria, were associated with survival. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See

Instead, the radiologic approach to the kidney has focused on the Bosniak classification system, which is based on imaging characteristics for cystic renal masses, and detecting macroscopic fat within solid renal masses. Radiologically, cystic and solid renal masses are categorized and evaluated separately because of historical precedent, differences in appearance at imaging, and differences in biologic behavior. However, the World Health Organization classification of renal neoplasms does not support such separation. Further, the primary goal has been cancer diagnosis. Differentiating benign from malignant masses is important, but data show that many renal cancers, particularly when small, will not cause harm. Therefore, a critical goal of any unifying, single, imaging-based classification of kidney masses (ie, a Kidney Imaging Reporting and Data System) should be predicting the biologic behavior or aggressiveness of suspected kidney cancer. This system could inform the need for treatment or active surveillance and reduce prevalent overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This review describes the rationale for and challenges in creating such a system and the research needed for it to be developed.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40100027/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40100027</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC11950888/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=0401260&ff=20250416021919&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">PMC11950888</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.240308>10.1148/radiol.240308</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Stuart G Silverman","Ivan Pedrosa","Nicola Schieda","Vitaly Margulis","Payal Kapur","Matthew S Davenport"],"dates":["2025-03-18"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40100027","pmc:PMC11950888","doi:10.1148/radiol.240308"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Radiology"],"subjects":[],"titles":["In Pursuit of KI-RADS: Toward a Single, Evidence-based Imaging Classification of Renal Masses"],"types":[]}}],"extensions":{"atom":{"link":[{"name":"atom:link","value":null,"attrs":{"href":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?sort=date&term=0401260%20%5BNLMID%5D&ff=20250416021919&utm_content=0401260&fc=None&utm_source=no_user_agent&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414&utm_campaign=journals&utm_medium=rss","rel":"self"},"children":{}}]}},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":null,"syndication_ext":null,"namespaces":{"atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom","content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"}}
