A precise diagnosis, which is influenced by a number of variables, such as the size or volume of the tumor, the types and stages of the cancer, etc., is essential for the treatment of patients with kidney cancer. In this work two main types of kidney cancer: normal and abnormal, using the accessible KiTS21 dataset of contrast-enhanced CT scans and associated data from patients. Many of these techniques show poor accuracy, which raises doubts regarding their efficiency and dependability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents the use of a double-decker convolutional neural network with the great wall construction algorithm (DDCNN-GWCA). Hybrid quick conventional bilateral filter improves the quality of pre-processed data by reducing noise while preserving crucial information by using the KiTS21 dataset. Practical Quantum K-Means Clustering is used for segmentation to improve detection efficiency and accuracy. The Q-value Regularized Transformer (QT) is a feature extraction method that combines the power of transformers with Q-value regularization to capture the relevant features. A Double-Decker Convolutional Neural Network's multi-layered architecture is used for classification to identify the classes. The Great Wall Construction Algorithm is an innovative optimization technique that optimizes the hyperparameters of the Double Decker Convolutional Neural Network (DDCNN), ensuring enhanced performance. It obtained scores of 98.9% for the KiTS21 dataset. These results demonstrate the strategy's ability to outperform existing methods and open the way for major advances in the diagnosis of kidney cancer.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40186648/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250406081345&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40186648</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04900-4>10.1007/s00261-025-04900-4</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Harish Kumar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Anuradha Taluja</dc:creator><dc:creator>Elangovan Muniyandy</dc:creator><dc:creator>Srinivas Kolli</dc:creator><dc:date>2025-04-05</dc:date><dc:identifier>pmid:40186648</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04900-4</dc:identifier><dc:source>Abdominal radiology (New York)</dc:source><dc:title>Kidney cancer diagnosis and surgery selection by double decker convolutional neural network from CT scans combined with great wall construction algorithm</dc:title></item><item><title>SpaceOAR hydrogel complications in prostate cancer radiotherapy: a pictorial review</title><link>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40186647/?utm_source=no_user_agent&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=journals&amp;utm_content=101674571&amp;fc=None&amp;ff=20250406081345&amp;v=2.18.0.post9+e462414</link><description><![CDATA[Since its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the rectal hydrogel spacer system SpaceOAR (SpaceOAR™ and Space-OAR Vue™, Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States) has become widely adopted in radiation therapy protocols for prostate cancer patients.

Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a congenital anomaly characterized by the retention of Müllerian duct remnants in males. TTE is a characteristic clinical finding in PMDS. This case report describes a patient in his 50s who was diagnosed with PMDS based on TTE findings and a pelvic structure suggestive of a Müllerian duct remnant. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the normal left testis within the left scrotum. The soft tissue was identified dorsal to the left testis, supplied from branches of bilateral internal iliac arteries. Additionally, a rod-like structure was observed in the left pelvis, appearing continuous with the soft tissue in the left scrotum. The right testis, enlarged and torsed, was located cranially within the left scrotum. A cord-like structure extended continuously from this ectopically positioned right testis toward the right inguinal region. Surgical findings revealed a normal left testis and torsion of the right testis. The right testis was removed. Histological examination revealed a seminoma within the right testis, and immunostaining confirmed the presence of attached Müllerian duct remnants. Prior imaging revealed that the right testis was located in the abdominal cavity, indicating that TTE in this case did not occur during testicular descent. In PMDS cases, TTE is believed to result from the traction of one testis by Müllerian duct remnants and the testicular mobility due to an abnormally long gubernaculum, which is a crucial role in normal testicular descent. The findings in this case support this theory and further indicate that TTE can occur even after testicular descent is complete. This report describes a case of TTE with a causative Müllerian duct remnant and a presumed abnormally long gubernaculum identified on imaging, which contributes to the understanding of this rare condition.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40169408/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250406081345&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40169408</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04915-x>10.1007/s00261-025-04915-x</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Keisuke Hidaka</dc:creator><dc:creator>Akihiro Furuta</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nobuyuki Mori</dc:creator><dc:creator>Takuya Maekura</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fuki Shitano</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Naoko Nishio</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yumiko Fujiwara</dc:creator><dc:creator>Toshiya Takamura</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kotoe Hidaka</dc:creator><dc:creator>Toshiki Shiozaki</dc:creator><dc:date>2025-04-01</dc:date><dc:identifier>pmid:40169408</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04915-x</dc:identifier><dc:source>Abdominal radiology (New York)</dc:source><dc:title>Transverse testicular ectopia with persistent müllerian duct syndrome: a case report</dc:title></item><item><title>Optimizing bladder magnetic resonance imaging: accelerating scan time and improving image quality through deep learning</title><link>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167648/?utm_source=no_user_agent&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=journals&amp;utm_content=101674571&amp;fc=None&amp;ff=20250406081345&amp;v=2.18.0.post9+e462414</link><description><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: Our study preliminarily demonstrated the feasibility of T2-weighted imaging with DL reconstruction of bladder MR in clinical practice.

Among them, 355 patients from Center 1 were divided into two groups at a 7:3 ratio: the training cohort (n = 248) and the internal validation cohort (n = 107). An additional 103 patients from two other centers served as the external validation cohort. Deep learning models were constructed for T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) based on the CrossFormer architecture, and deep learning features were extracted. Subsequently, a feature ensemble module based on the attention mechanism of Transformer was used to capture spatial interactions between different imaging sequences, creating a multiparametric ensemble model. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">RESULTS: The deep learning model based on T2WI achieved AUC values of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.680-0.900) and 0.720 (95% CI: 0.591-0.849) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The deep learning model based on DWI had AUC values of 0.806 (95% CI: 0.705-0.908) and 0.772 (95% CI: 0.657-0.887) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The multiparametric ensemble model demonstrated superior performance, with AUC values of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.775-0.960) in the internal validation cohort and 0.839 (95% CI: 0.743-0.935) in the external validation cohort. DeLong test showed that the differences in AUC values among the models were not statistically significant in both the internal and external test sets (P &gt; 0.05). The DCA curve demonstrated that within the 10-80% threshold range, the fusion model provided significantly higher clinical net benefit compared to other models.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">CONCLUSION: Compared to single-sequence deep learning models, the attention mechanism-based multiparametric MRI fusion model enables more effective individualized prediction of TB grading in RC patients.

The training and validation cohort comprised CT scans of 317 patients (center 1). The internal test cohort comprised a temporally independent cohort (n = 29) from center 1 (internal test 1). The external test cohort comprised CT scans from three centers [ (n = 85)]. We trained the state-of-the-art 2D and 3D image segmentation models, SAM Adapter, MedSAM, 3D TransUNet, SAM-Med3D, and 3D-nnU-Net, for automated segmentation of the GBC. The models' performance for GBC segmentation on the test datasets was assessed via dice score and intersection over union (IoU) using manual segmentation as the reference standard.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">RESULTS: The 2D models performed better than 3D models. Overall, MedSAM achieved the highest dice and IoU scores on both the internal [mean dice (SD) 0.776 (0.106) and mean IoU 0.653 (0.133)] and external [mean dice (SD) 0.763 (0.098) and mean IoU 0.637 (0.116)] test sets. Among the 3D models, TransUNet showed the best segmentation performance with mean dice (SD) and IoU (SD) of 0.479 (0.268) and 0.356 (0.235) in the internal test and 0.409 (0.339) and 0.317 (0.283) in the external test sets. The segmentation performance was not associated with GBC morphology. There was weak correlation between the dice/IoU and the size of the GBC lesions for any segmentation model.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">CONCLUSION: We trained 2D and 3D GBC segmentation models on a large dataset and validated these models on external datasets.

To better direct future research, this descriptive review summarizes the general landscape of AI applications in endometriosis imaging. Articles from PubMed were selected to represent different approaches to AI applications in endometriosis imaging. Current endometriosis imaging literature focuses on AI applications in ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most studies use US data, with MRI studies being limited at present. The majority of US studies employ transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) data and aim to detect deep endometriosis implants, adenomyosis, endometriomas, and secondary signs of endometriosis. Most MRI studies evaluate endometriosis disease diagnosis and segmentation. Some studies analyze multi-modal methods for endometriosis imaging, combining US and MRI data or using imaging data in combination with clinical data. Current literature lacks generalizability and standardization. Most studies in this review utilize small sample sizes with retrospective approaches and single-center data. Existing models only focus on narrow disease detection or diagnosis questions and lack standardized ground truth. Overall, AI applications in endometriosis imaging analysis are in their early stages, and continued research is essential to develop and enhance these models.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40167644/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250406081345&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40167644</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04897-w>10.1007/s00261-025-04897-w</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Sneha Mittal</dc:creator><dc:creator>Angela Tong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Scott Young</dc:creator><dc:creator>Priyanka Jha</dc:creator><dc:date>2025-04-01</dc:date><dc:identifier>pmid:40167644</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04897-w</dc:identifier><dc:source>Abdominal radiology (New York)</dc:source><dc:title>Artificial intelligence applications in endometriosis imaging</dc:title></item></channel></rss>"
