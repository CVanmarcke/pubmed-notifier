Some patients with endometriosis may require surgical intervention or assisted reproductive technologies to conceive. Although many patients who achieve pregnancy have relatively uncomplicated outcomes because of the progesterone-induced regression of endometriotic lesions, complications can still arise during pregnancy and the peripartum period. Complications include the decidualization of endometriosis implants, with site-specific implications (e.g., decidualized endometrioma mimicking ovarian cancer, decidualized deep endometriosis infiltrating the myometrium leading to uterine rupture, spontaneous hemoperitoneum), placenta previa, preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes, postpartum hemorrhage, or systemic conditions such as hypertensive or coagulation disorders. Herein, we review the background of these conditions and the expected radiologic findings. Additionally, we review essential clinical concepts about the treatment available and the information needed to make health care decisions. This review aims to equip radiologists with essential insights into the challenges faced by patients with endometriosis, from infertility diagnosis through postpartum care. By enhancing radiologists' understanding of these aspects and relevant imaging findings, we aspire to improve maternal and fetal outcomes affected by this complex condition.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232414/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40232414</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04935-7>10.1007/s00261-025-04935-7</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Pamela Causa Andrieu","Kelsey Stewart","Rebecca Chun","Madison Breiland","Luciana P Chamie","Kristine Burk","Michael F Ii Neblett","Zaraq Khan","Jeannette Lager","Wendaline VanBuren","Liina Poder"],"dates":["2025-04-15"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40232414","doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04935-7"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Abdominal radiology (New York)"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Endometriosis: a journey from infertility to fertility"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Advancing endometriosis detection in daily practice: a deep learning-enhanced multi-sequence MRI analytical model","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232413/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&fc=None&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"CONCLUSION: This study introduced the first DL model to use multi-sequence MRI on a large cohort, showing results equivalent to human detection by trained readers in identifying endometriosis.","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40232413","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Tue, 15 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Abdom Radiol (NY). 2025 Apr 15. doi: 10.1007/s00261-025-04942-8.

Despite its prevalence, diagnosing endometriosis through imaging remains challenging. Advances in deep learning (DL) are revolutionizing the diagnosis and management of complex medical conditions. This study aims to evaluate DL tools in enhancing the accuracy of multi-sequence MRI-based detection of endometriosis.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">METHOD: We gathered a patient cohort from our institutional database, composed of patients with pathologically confirmed endometriosis from 2015 to 2024. We created an age-matched control group that underwent a similar MR protocol without an endometriosis diagnosis. We used sagittal fat-saturated T1-weighted (T1W FS) pre- and post-contrast and T2-weighted (T2W) MRIs. Our dataset was split at the patient level, allocating 12.5% for testing and conducting seven-fold cross-validation on the remainder. Seven abdominal radiologists with experience in endometriosis MRI and complex surgical planning and one women's imaging fellow with specific training in endometriosis MRI reviewed a random selection of images and documented their endometriosis detection.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">RESULTS: 395 and 356 patients were included in the case and control groups respectively. The final 3D-DenseNet-121 classifier model demonstrated robust performance. Our findings indicated the most accurate predictions were obtained using T2W, T1W FS pre-, and post-contrast images. Using an ensemble technique on the test set resulted in an F1 Score of 0.881, AUROCC of 0.911, sensitivity of 0.976, and specificity of 0.720. Radiologists achieved 84.48% and 87.93% sensitivity without and with AI assistance in detecting endometriosis. The agreement among radiologists in predicting labels for endometriosis was measured as a Fleiss' kappa of 0.5718 without AI assistance and 0.6839 with AI assistance.</p><p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:p1=\"http://pubmed.gov/pub-one\">CONCLUSION: This study introduced the first DL model to use multi-sequence MRI on a large cohort, showing results equivalent to human detection by trained readers in identifying endometriosis.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40232413/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40232413</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04942-8>10.1007/s00261-025-04942-8</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Mana Moassefi","Shahriar Faghani","Ceylan Colak","Shannon P Sheedy","Pamela L Causa Andrieu","Sherry S Wang","Rachel L McPhedran","Kristina T Flicek","Garima Suman","Hiroaki Takahashi","Candice A Bookwalter","Tatnai L Burnett","Bradley J Erickson","Wendaline M VanBuren"],"dates":["2025-04-15"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40232413","doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04942-8"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Abdominal radiology (New York)"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Advancing endometriosis detection in daily practice: a deep learning-enhanced multi-sequence MRI analytical model"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Influence variables of ultrasound-derived fat fraction in liver fat content measurement: preprandial and postprandial states","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220168/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&fc=None&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"CONCLUSIONS: UDFF has good consistency in the measurement of liver fat content in preprandial and postprandial states.","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40220168","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Sat, 12 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Abdom Radiol (NY). 2025 Apr 12. doi: 10.1007/s00261-025-04909-9.

The objective of this study was to develop an optimized radiomics scheme combining multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), deep learning, and machine learning to predict biological features including myometrial invasion (MI), lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI), histologic grade (HG), and estrogen receptor (ER). This retrospective study involved 201 EC patients, who were divided into four groups according to the specific tasks. The proposed radiomics scheme extracted quantitative imaging features and multidimensional deep learning features from multiparametric MRI. Several classifiers were employed to predict biological features. Model performance and interpretability were assessed using traditional classification metrics, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) techniques. In the deep MI (DMI) prediction task, the proposed protocol achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.960 (95% CI 0.9005-1.0000) in the test cohort. In the LVSI prediction task, the AUC of the proposed scheme in the test cohort was 0.924 (95% CI 0.7760-1.0000). In the HG prediction task, the AUC value of the proposed scheme in the test cohort was 0.937 (95% CI 0.8561-1.0000). In the ER prediction task, the AUC value of the proposed scheme in the test cohort was 0.929 (95% CI 0.7991-1.0000). The proposed radiomics scheme outperformed the comparative scheme and effectively extracted imaging features related to the expression of EC biological characteristics, providing potential clinical significance for accurate diagnosis and treatment decision-making.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40214699/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40214699</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04929-5>10.1007/s00261-025-04929-5</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Zhichao Wang","Chuchu He","Zhen Liu","Haifeng Luo","Jingjing Li","Jinyuan Xie","Chao Li","Xiandong Wu","Yan Hu","Jun Cai"],"dates":["2025-04-11"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40214699","doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04929-5"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Abdominal radiology (New York)"],"subjects":[],"titles":["Biological characteristics prediction of endometrial cancer based on deep convolutional neural network and multiparametric MRI radiomics"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Development of a model combining CEUS LI-RADS and clinical features for predicting glypican-3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40214698/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&fc=None&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"CONCLUSION: The combined model incorporating clinical features and CEUS LI-RADS achieved a satisfactory performance for predicting GPC3 expression in HCC patients.","author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"enclosure":null,"guid":{"value":"pubmed:40214698","permalink":false},"pub_date":"Fri, 11 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400","source":null,"content":"<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Abdom Radiol (NY). 2025 Apr 11. doi: 10.1007/s00261-025-04861-8.

We report a case of PUC with characteristic radiological findings. A male patient in his 70s presented with nocturnal urinary incontinence; cystoscopy findings suggested cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 6-mm-sized protruding lesion of the bladder with early contrast enhancement and diffusion restriction, indicative of bladder cancer. Additionally, a diffuse bladder wall thickening, abnormal signal intensity, and contrast enhancement were observed around the bladder. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed no significant FDG uptake in the lesion. The possibility of peritoneal dissemination of gastrointestinal malignancy was considered; however, no obvious primary lesions were identified. PUC was suggested as a differential diagnosis, prompting random bladder biopsies during resection of a protruding lesion in the bladder. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed PUC, with positivity for CD138, CK7, and GATA3 and negativity for CDX-2 and E-cadherin. Following treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin, the lesion size decreased. Diagnosis of PUC can be difficult because the lesion is not easily detected by cystoscopy, misdiagnosed as peritoneal dissemination of gastrointestinal cancer on CT or MRI, or histopathologically similar to plasmacytoma or malignant lymphoma. PUC may present with pelvic peritoneal spread of the tumor as thick sheets extending along the fascial planes, which may be a characteristic imaging finding. Radiologists must be aware of these typical imaging findings to ensure accurate diagnosis of PUC.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40214695/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414\">40214695</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-025-04940-w>10.1007/s00261-025-04940-w</a></p></div>","extensions":{},"itunes_ext":null,"dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["Fumiko Yagi","Hirotaka Akita","Kazuhiro Matsumoto","Takeo Kosaka","Akihisa Ueno","Shunsuke Nakamura","Yuki Hasunuma","Tomo Taketani","Hajime Okita","Mototsugu Oya","Masahiro Jinzaki"],"dates":["2025-04-11"],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":["pmid:40214695","doi:10.1007/s00261-025-04940-w"],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":["Abdominal radiology (New York)"],"subjects":[],"titles":["A case of plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma with characteristic radiological findings"],"types":[]}},{"title":"Differentiating uterine adenosarcoma from endometrial polyps: MRI imaging features","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40210681/?utm_source=no_user_agent&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journals&utm_content=101674571&fc=None&ff=20250416021931&v=2.18.0.post9+e462414","description":"CONCLUSIONS: This study identified key imaging features of uterine adenosarcoma, including larger tumor volume, larger cystic lesions, gross intratumoral hemorrhage, higher DWI signal intensity, and lower ADC values.
